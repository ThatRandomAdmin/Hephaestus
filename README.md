# HEPHAESTUS

**HEPHAESTUS** is a desktop application that allows you to create text-based RPGs, visually. Design your game world by placing and connecting tiles to represent cities, towns, shops, dungeons, and more — all with a simple drag-and-drop interface. Once your world is complete, export it as a playable game build.
